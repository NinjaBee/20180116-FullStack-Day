            <h3>Family and Childhood</h3>
            <p>
                Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas and Nancy Hanks Lincoln,
                in a one-room log cabin on the Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky.[7] He was a
                descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake of
                Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. Samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's western
                migration, which passed through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.[8][9] Lincoln's paternal
                grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln, moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson
                County, Kentucky, in the 1780s.[10] Captain Lincoln was killed in an Indian raid in 1786. His
                children, including eight-year-old Thomas,[12] the future president's father, witnessed the
                attack.[13][14][15] After his father's murder, Thomas was left to make his own way on the
                frontier, working at odd jobs in Kentucky and in Tennessee, before settling with members of his
                family in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.

            <h3>Early Career and Militia Service</h3>
            <p>
                In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in New Salem,
                Illinois.[81] Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln
                eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for
                the Illinois General Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural
                raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be
                why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.[82][83]

            <h3>Prairie Lawyer</h3>
            <p>
                Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business
                that could come before a prairie lawyer".[117] Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he
                appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session.[118]
                Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion,
                particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad
                bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented
                whoever hired him.[119] In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company
                in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.[120][121] In 1849, he
                received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was
                never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.[122][123]

                Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who
                served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April
                1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and perhaps its
                greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.[2][3] In doing so, he preserved the Union,
                paved the way for the abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized
                the economy.
