# music-share

### overview
General music sharing / recommendation / blog using the Discogs and Bandcamp API.

Users can search index of previously shared artists / media or signup to submit a record / artist / label for recommendation. Visitors and users can signup for email notifications if content or reviews have been added. As a user, you can save info to collections or wishlist to DB.

Once band / genre / label is searched, site will return data with name(s), basic bio, discography and related artists. Basic web-scraping could be used to track info posted in the past 6 months including new releases, reissues, tour and / or other info if available. Maybe import streamable content via bandcamp if available.
