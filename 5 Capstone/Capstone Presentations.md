# Capstone Presentations

Presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

The structure of your presentation is entirely up to you. However, it's often best to first explain your idea and how you went about designing and developing your project. You can then run the application and show its features and interaction (entering data, seeing results, etc). Finally you can take a walk through the different parts of your code.

Here are some questions to contemplate while planning out your presentation:

- what problem your application solve? what is the core function it performs?
- how did you go about planning?
- what major issues did you encounter during the course of development? how did you go about overcoming them?
- how did your vision for the project change over time?
- what part did you like the most? least?
- what is the future of the project? what features (if any) will you work on next?

**Please test your laptop with the monitor/projector before the presentations begin**. Also remember that it's normal to feel awkward, the entire industry is full of awkward people. Please remember these three things during your presentation:

1) Project your voice
2) Use technical terms
3) Take a moment to savor the applause at the end because you've earned it
